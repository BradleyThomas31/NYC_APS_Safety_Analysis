This project aims to analyze the relationship between the installation of Accessible Pedestrian Signals (APS) 
and pedestrian-traffic collisions at intersections in New York City between 2013 and 2023.

Microsoft Excel and SQL were used for initial data processing and the removal of unrelated data points. 
Tableau was used for all data visualizations.

All data was provided by NYC OpenData.

Note: Upon reviewing the pedestrian-vehicle collisions data from OpenData, significant inconsistencies were 
identified, which may impact the accuracy of the analysis.
